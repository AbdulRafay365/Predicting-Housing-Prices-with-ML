# King County Real Estate Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
After analyzing King County housing prices and building predictive models in this [repository](https://github.com/AbdulRafay365/Predicting-Housing-Prices-with-ML), I built this interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing housing market trends between 1990-2015. This dashboard visualizes price fluctuations, property features distribution, and sales conditions through dynamic filters and heatmaps.
